## 📊 SMOKING GUNS (Prioritized)

### 1. **The Contradictory Financial Reports** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What They Report:**
- To Secretary of State: $0 lobbying expenses (all 6 years)

**What Audited Statements Show:**
- Professional Fees: $96,753 (FY 2023-2024)

**Why This Matters:**
These are two official government filings. They cannot both be true. Someone is committing perjury.

**Visual Evidence:** claims_vs_evidence_table.png (Row 2)

---

### 2. **The Grant-Driven Salary** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Before Grant (FY 2020-2023):**
- Ruth Zakarin CEO salary: $0
- Ruth Zakarin lobbying: $120,000

**After Grant (FY 2024):**
- Ruth Zakarin CEO salary: $98,200
- Ruth Zakarin lobbying: $10,000
- Professional fees jumped 70%

**Why This Matters:**
Same person, same work, just relabeled from "lobbying" to "CEO" to access grant money. The grant is paying a lobbyist's salary.

**Visual Evidence:** financial_analysis_charts.png (Panel 1 & 4)

---

### 3. **The Lobbying-to-Grant Pipeline** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Step 1 (Feb 2022):** Ruth donates $50 to Campbell  
**Step 2 (Jan 2023):** Campbell becomes AG  
**Step 3 (2023-2024):** Coalition lobbies for "budget line items"  
**Step 4 (Apr 2025):** AG announces grant, Coalition receives it  
**Step 5 (May 2025):** Coalition immediately hires staff and launches campaign  

**Why This Matters:**
This is the exact pipeline they designed: lobby for government funding → secure government funding → expand lobbying operation with taxpayer money.

**Visual Evidence:** timeline_infographic.png, money_flow_diagram.png

---

### 4. **The Phantom Expenses** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impossible Math:**
- Ruth Zakarin works 40 hours/week as lobbyist
- Paid $155,000 over 6 years
- Reports $0 expenses (every year)
- But Coalition pays $97K in "professional fees"
- And $107K to Charles Group

**Why This Matters:**
Professional lobbying cannot be done with zero expenses. Either the registration is fraudulent or the expenses are being hidden in other budget categories. Either way, it's false reporting.

**Visual Evidence:** financial_analysis_charts.png (Panel 6)

---

### 5. **The Ballot Committee Blackout** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Legal Requirement:**
- File Form CPF 101 BQ within 10 days
- File periodic reports showing all money
- Penalty: $25/day for non-filing

**Reality:**
- Launched: May 12, 2025
- Filings as of Nov 23, 2025: **ZERO**
- Days late: 195+
- Penalties owed: $4,875+

**Comparison:**
- Opposition (Civil Rights Coalition): Files everything, fully transparent
- Coalition's campaign: Complete financial blackout

**Why This Matters:**
Ruth knows how to file OCPF reports (41 personal donations filed correctly). She properly files lobbying reports. But ballot committee? Nothing. This is intentional concealment.

**Visual Evidence:** OCPF database search results (documented in FINAL_OCPF_Analysis.md)

---

## 📧 MEDIA PITCH TEMPLATE

**Subject:** Investigation Reveals $359K Lobbying Operation Disguised as "Education" Nonprofit

**Body:**

I am sharing with you the results of a comprehensive investigation into the Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit that claims to provide "public health education."

Public records reveal the organization has spent at least $359,053 on professional lobbying services while maintaining tax-exempt status and receiving government grants for "education."

Key findings:
• CEO paid $155,000 as registered lobbyist, reports $0 expenses
• Hired professional lobbying firm for $107,300
• Audited financial statements show $97,000 in undisclosed professional fees
• CEO donated to AG candidate, who later gave organization grant
• Professional fees spiked 70% after receiving grant
• Ballot committee chairman (same CEO) has filed zero reports for 6 months

Complete investigation with source documents and visualizations:
[GitHub URL]

This appears to be systematic fraud involving misrepresentation to the IRS, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and Office of Campaign and Political Finance.

I am available to discuss the findings and provide additional documentation.
